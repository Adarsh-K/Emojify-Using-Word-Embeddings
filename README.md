# I've made an Emojifier using Word Embedding and LSTMs. The code is in Python and uses Keras.
Note: All the files are well documented and commented wherever I felt necessary

Run the file named EmojifyUsingWordmbedding.ipynb which does the following:
1. Loads the Dataset and displays a part of it
2. Reads the Word Embeddings(glove.6B.50d.txt)- I can't upload them as the file is very big thus not allowed on GitHub
3. Convert array of sentences (strings) into an array of indices corresponding to words in the sentences.
4. Create Keras Embedding() layer and loads in pre-trained GloVe 50-dimensional vectors.
5. Create Emojify's model graph
6. Shows mislabbed outputs of my model
7. Finally, feel free to test your sentence
